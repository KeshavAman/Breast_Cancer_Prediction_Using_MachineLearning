# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_Using_MachineLearning
Breast cancer is considered to be one of the significant causes of death in women. Early detection of breast cancer plays an essential role to save womenâ€™s life. Breast cancer detection can be done with the help of modern machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we focus on how to deal with imbalanced data that have missing values using resampling techniques to enhance the classification accuracy of detecting breast cancer
